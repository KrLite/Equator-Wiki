# ðŸ’¾ Module Implementation

**Equator** should not be included into your mod as it has many independent functions. However, this instruction shows you how to include **Equator** as modules.

Note well that all the modules **work as mods,** and depend on Fabric because the usage of certain functions. However, they are safe to be included in your project.

First of all, add [**JitPack**](https://jitpack.io/#KrLite/Equator-v2) to your repositories.

{% code title="build.gradle" overflow="wrap" %}
```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```
{% endcode %}

## Including Modules

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Animation" %}
{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```gradle
dependencies {
    modImplementation include("com.github.KrLite.Equator-v2:Animation:a.b.c-v?")
}
```
{% endcode %}

Module **Animation** contains classes including **Animation, Interpolation** and **Slice.**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Math" %}
{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```gradle
dependencies {
    modImplementation include("com.github.KrLite.Equator-v2:Math:a.b.c-v?")
}
```
{% endcode %}

Module **Math** contains classes including **Vector, Box, Theory** and **FrameInfo.**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Visual" %}
{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```gradle
dependencies {
    modImplementation include("com.github.KrLite.Equator-v2:Visual:a.b.c-v?")
}
```
{% endcode %}

Module **Visual** contains classes including **AccurateColor** and **Palette.**
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* `a.b.c` stands for **Minecraft** version, you should always use **the full version,** for example, `1.19.4`. If the version does not exist, consider trying again **excluding the min version,** for example, `1.19`. If the version still does not exist, **Equator** may not supporting the target **Minecraft** version.
* `v?` stands for **Equator** version, which is **equivalent to the release tag,** for example, `v2.0.0`. Using the latest version is recommended.
* Not all versions support all Minecraft versions, **please check the requirements before implementing.**

> All modules' methods and classes are strictly in line with **Equator**'s, which enables you switching to **Equator** at any time.
